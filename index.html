                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>Mission is the core purpose of an organization or a company. It is a summary of the aims and core
                    values. A mission clearly tells what you as an organization does for customers. A mission is
                    comprehensive but also very specific to set you apart from other organizations.</p>

                <h2>Vission</h2>
                <p>
                    Vision is the ability to close your eyes and imagine a future that not yet exist. It is the ability
                    to see beyond the mess that may be in front of you, to abstract away from it, to clean it up and see
                    a (hopefully better) future that does not yet exist.

                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>Aspirations are hopes and dreams for your future. These are often big and complex goals. They may
                    take a lot of work and time to achieve. ... This is a shorter-term goal that would be a step towards
                    your aspiration. You know you have achieved this goal when you complete the course successfully.</p>
